Pleased to share our recent contribution to a compendium on Interorgan Crosstalk in Heart Failure and Cardiometabolic Disease, now published in Circulation Research.

We teamed up with clinical trialists and multidisciplinary experts to examine the evolving landscape of interorgan communication in heart failure, with a focus on the cardio-kidney-liver-metabolic axis. This topic is particularly relevant to us in Singapore, where cardiovascular and metabolic diseases are highly prevalent and intersecting in complex ways.

Grateful to our collaborators and the editors for the opportunity to be part of this important effort !
