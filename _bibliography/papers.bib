   abstract = {The Human Genome Project marked a major milestone in the scientific community as it unravelled the ~3 billion bases that are central to crucial aspects of human life. Despite this achievement, it only scratched the surface of understanding how each nucleotide matters, both individually and as part of a larger unit. Beyond the coding genome, which comprises only ~2% of the whole genome, scientists have realized that large portions of the genome, not known to code for any protein, were crucial for regulating the coding genes. These large portions of the genome comprise the 'non-coding genome'. The history of gene regulation mediated by proteins that bind to the regulatory non-coding genome dates back many decades to the 1960s. However, the original definition of 'enhancers' was first used in the early 1980s. In this Review, we summarize benchmark studies that have mapped the role of cardiac enhancers in disease and development. We highlight instances in which enhancer-localized genetic variants explain the missing link to cardiac pathogenesis. Finally, we inspire readers to consider the next phase of exploring enhancer-based gene therapy for cardiovascular disease.},

   abstract = {Selection of the target site is an inherent question for any project aiming for directed transgene integration. Genomic safe harbour (GSH) loci have been proposed as safe sites in the human genome for transgene integration. Although several sites have been characterised for transgene integration in the literature, most of these do not meet criteria set out for a GSH and the limited set that do have not been characterised extensively. Here, we conducted a computational analysis using publicly available data to identify 25 unique putative GSH loci that reside in active chromosomal compartments. We validated stable transgene expression and minimal disruption of the native transcriptome in three GSH sites in vitro using human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and their differentiated progeny. Furthermore, for easy targeted transgene expression, we have engineered constitutive landing pad expression constructs into the three validated GSH in hESCs.},

   abstract = {The ongoing debate on whether non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an active contributor or an innocent bystander in the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) has sparked interests in understanding the common mediators between the two biologically distinct entities. This comprehensive review identifies and curates genetic studies of NAFLD overlapping with CVD, and describes the colinear as well as opposing correlations between genetic associations for the two diseases. Here, CVD described in relation to NAFLD are coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy and atrial fibrillation. Unique findings of this review included certain NAFLD susceptibility genes that possessed cardioprotective properties. Moreover, the complex interactions of genetic and environmental risk factors shed light on the disparity in genetic influence on NAFLD and its incident CVD. This serves to unravel NAFLD-mediated pathways in order to reduce CVD events, and helps identify targeted treatment strategies, develop polygenic risk scores to improve risk prediction and personalise disease prevention.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The human genome folds in 3 dimensions to form thousands of chromatin loops inside the nucleus, encasing genes and cis-regulatory elements for accurate gene expression control. Physical tethers of loops are anchored by the DNA-binding protein CTCF and the cohesin ring complex. Because heart failure is characterized by hallmark gene expression changes, it was recently reported that substantial CTCF-related chromatin reorganization underpins the myocardial stress-gene response, paralleled by chromatin domain boundary changes observed in CTCF knockout. METHODS: We undertook an independent and orthogonal analysis of chromatin organization with mouse pressure-overload model of myocardial stress (transverse aortic constriction) and cardiomyocyte-specific knockout of Ctcf. We also downloaded published data sets of similar cardiac mouse models and subjected them to independent reanalysis. RESULTS: We found that the cardiomyocyte chromatin architecture remains broadly stable in transverse aortic constriction hearts, whereas Ctcf knockout resulted in approximately 99% abolition of global chromatin loops. Disease gene expression changes correlated instead with differential histone H3K27-acetylation enrichment at their respective proximal and distal interacting genomic enhancers confined within these static chromatin structures. Moreover, coregulated genes were mapped out as interconnected gene sets on the basis of their multigene 3D interactions. CONCLUSIONS: This work reveals a more stable genome-wide chromatin framework than previously described. Myocardial stress-gene transcription responds instead through H3K27-acetylation enhancer enrichment dynamics and gene networks of coregulation. Robust and intact CTCF looping is required for the induction of a rapid and accurate stress response.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a severe, non-ischemic heart disease which ultimately results in heart failure (HF). Decades of research on DCM have revealed diverse aetiologies. Among them, familial DCM is the major form of DCM, with pathogenic variants in LMNA being the second most common form of autosomal dominant DCM. LMNA DCM is a multifactorial and complex disease with no specific treatment thus far. Many studies have demonstrated that perturbing candidates related to various dysregulated pathways ameliorate LMNA DCM. However, it is unknown whether these candidates could serve as potential therapeutic targets especially in long term efficacy. METHODS: We evaluated 14 potential candidates including Lmna gene products (Lamin A and Lamin C), key signaling pathways (Tgfbeta/Smad, mTor and Fgf/Mapk), calcium handling, proliferation regulators and modifiers of LINC complex function in a cardiac specific Lmna DCM model. Positive candidates for improved cardiac function were further assessed by survival analysis. Suppressive roles and mechanisms of these candidates in ameliorating Lmna DCM were dissected by comparing marker gene expression, Tgfbeta signaling pathway activation, fibrosis, inflammation, proliferation and DNA damage. Furthermore, transcriptome profiling compared the differences between Lamin A and Lamin C treatment. RESULTS: Cardiac function was restored by several positive candidates (Smad3, Yy1, Bmp7, Ctgf, aYAP1, Sun1, Lamin A, and Lamin C), which significantly correlated with suppression of HF/fibrosis marker expression and cardiac fibrosis in Lmna DCM. Lamin C or Sun1 shRNA administration achieved consistent, prolonged survival which highly correlated with reduced heart inflammation and DNA damage. Importantly, Lamin A treatment improved but could not reproduce long term survival, and Lamin A administration to healthy hearts itself induced DCM. Mechanistically, we identified this lapse as caused by a dose-dependent toxicity of Lamin A, which was independent from its maturation. CONCLUSIONS: In vivo candidate evaluation revealed that supplementation of Lamin C or knockdown of Sun1 significantly suppressed Lmna DCM and achieve prolonged survival. Conversely, Lamin A supplementation did not rescue long term survival and may impart detrimental cardiotoxicity risk. This study highlights a potential of advancing Lamin C and Sun1 as therapeutic targets for the treatment of LMNA DCM.},

   abstract = {RATIONALE: Identifying genetic markers for heterogeneous complex diseases such as heart failure is challenging and requires prohibitively large cohort sizes in genome-wide association studies to meet the stringent threshold of genome-wide statistical significance. On the other hand, chromatin quantitative trait loci, elucidated by direct epigenetic profiling of specific human tissues, may contribute toward prioritizing subthreshold variants for disease association. OBJECTIVE: Here, we captured noncoding genetic variants by performing epigenetic profiling for enhancer H3K27ac chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing in 70 human control and end-stage failing hearts. METHODS AND RESULTS: We have mapped a comprehensive catalog of 47 321 putative human heart enhancers and promoters. Three thousand eight hundred ninety-seven differential acetylation peaks (FDR [false discovery rate], 5%) pointed to pathways altered in heart failure. To identify cardiac histone acetylation quantitative trait loci (haQTLs), we regressed out confounding factors including heart failure disease status and used the G-SCI (Genotype-independent Signal Correlation and Imbalance) test(1) to call out 1680 haQTLs (FDR, 10%). RNA sequencing performed on the same heart samples proved a subset of haQTLs to have significant association also to gene expression (expression quantitative trait loci), either in cis (180) or through long-range interactions (81), identified by Hi-C (high-throughput chromatin conformation assay) and HiChIP (high-throughput protein centric chromatin) performed on a subset of hearts. Furthermore, a concordant relationship between the gain or disruption of TF (transcription factor)-binding motifs, inferred from alternative alleles at the haQTLs, implied a surprising direct association between these specific TF and local histone acetylation in human hearts. Finally, 62 unique loci were identified by colocalization of haQTLs with the subthreshold loci of heart-related genome-wide association studies datasets. CONCLUSIONS: Disease and phenotype association for 62 unique loci are now implicated. These loci may indeed mediate their effect through modification of enhancer H3K27 acetylation enrichment and their corresponding gene expression differences (bioRxiv: https://doi.org/10.1101/536763).

   abstract = {Rho GTPases and Hippo kinases are key regulators of cardiomyoblast differentiation. However, how these signaling axes are coordinated spatiotemporally remains unclear. Here, the central and multifaceted roles of the BCH domain containing protein, BNIP-2, in orchestrating the expression of two key cardiac genes (cardiac troponin T [cTnT] and cardiac myosin light chain [Myl2]) in H9c2 and human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes are delineated. This study shows that BNIP-2 mRNA and protein expression increase with the onset of cTnT and Myl2 and promote the alignment of H9c2 cardiomyocytes. Mechanistically, BNIP-2 is required for the inactivation of YAP through YAP phosphorylation and its cytosolic retention. Turbo-ID proximity labeling corroborated by super-resolution analyses and biochemical pulldown data reveals a scaffolding role of BNIP-2 for LATS1 to phosphorylate and inactivate YAP in a process that requires BNIP-2 activation of cellular contractility. The findings identify BNIP-2 as a pivotal signaling scaffold that spatiotemporally integrates RhoA/Myosin II and LATS1/YAP mechanotransduction signaling to drive cardiomyoblast differentiation, by switching the genetic programming from YAP-dependent growth to YAP-silenced differentiation. These findings offer insights into the importance of scaffolding proteins in bridging the gap between mechanical and biochemical signals in cell growth and differentiation and the prospects in translational applications.},

abstract = {The 3D chromatin architecture establishes a complex network of genes and regulatory elements necessary for transcriptomic regulation in development and disease. This network can be modeled by cis-regulatory hubs (CRH) which underscore the local functional interactions between enhancers and promoter regions and differ from other higher order chromatin structures such as topological associated domains (TAD). The Activity-by-contact (ABC) model of enhancer-promoter regulation has been recently used in the identification of these CRHs, but little is known about the role of CTCF on the ABC scores and the consequent impact on CRHs. Here we show that the loss of CTCF leads to a reorganization of the enhancer-promoter interactions resulting in a re-distribution of ABC scores of the putative enhancers in C57/bl6 mouse hearts. The loss of CTCF also leads to a global reduction of the total number of CRHs, and an increase in the size of the CRHs due to increase in the number of elements within each hub. In addition, CTCF loss led to more CRHs that cross TAD boundaries. These results provide another layer of evidence to support the importance of CTCF in the formation of regulatory networks necessary for gene regulation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.ChIP-seqChromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencingATAC-seqAssay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin with sequencingHi-CHigh throughput chromatin conformation capture with sequencingABCActivity by contact algorithm},
