Hi, I'm Mick, a Stem Cell and computational biologist and post-doc based in Roger Foo's Group at the Cardiovascular Research Institute, National University of Singapore Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine. I also did my PhD here in Singapore at NUS and the Genome Institute of Singapore. I use functional genomics such as CRISPR screens and gene editing in 2D and 3D human stem-cell derived models, and building multi-modal reporter systems to study cardiac cell fate, gene regulation, disease and regeneration. On the computational side, I focused on understanding the cardiac regulome which include the integrative analysis and processing of multi-omics and disease GWAS datasets. I am excited about gene editing approaches and the application of stem cell research.
