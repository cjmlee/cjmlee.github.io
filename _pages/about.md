Mick is a Stem Cell and computational biologist based in Roger Foo's Group at the Cardiovascular Research Institute, National University of Singapore Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine. He obtain his bachelors and PhD here in Singapore at NUS and the Genome Institute of Singapore. He use functional genomics such as CRISPR screens and gene editing tools for application in 2D and 3D human stem-cell derived models, and building multi-modal reporter systems to study cardiac cell fate, gene regulation, disease and regeneration. On the computational side, he focused on understanding the cardiac regulome which include the integrative analysis and processing of multi-omics and disease GWAS datasets. He is excited about gene editing approaches and the application of stem cell research to treat cardiovascular diseases
